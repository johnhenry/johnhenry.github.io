# Component Theory

At the most basic level, a component is a piece of markup that represents combinations (permutations) of other pieces of markup.
Also implicit within the component are associated _styles_ and _behavior_.

## Class attribute

Be as specific as possible as to what you want to style.
Things not accounted for should be minimally affected.
Use css modules.
Use low specificity as to avoid conflicts.
Style as little as possible.
Avoid "greedy" css (high specificity, !important)
Avoid conflicts.

One way to identify an html element as a component it to give it a corresponding class attibute.

```html
<span class="name-of-component"> </span>
```
